# Time_Series_Analysis
This project analyzes historical electricity consumption in India and forecasts future demand using time series techniques. The data was tested for stationarity using the ADF and KPSS tests, and an ARIMA model was applied for forecasting. Model performance was validated using the Box-Ljung test.
Tools used include Excel (data preprocessing), R (modeling), and Tableau (visualization).
The analysis highlights an increasing trend in electricity consumption and demonstrates how time series models can support energy planning and decision-making.
